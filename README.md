I asked if IITC was okay and well, the answer is no. It seems Niantic wants to sit this one out, even after *a lot* of people spoke out for IITC. So thank you, dear supporters and shame on you Niantic.

# Alternatives

I personally recommend all users and contributors to switch over to this fork:
https://github.com/jonatkins/ingress-intel-total-conversion

It’s already been made more resilient to take down notices. I hope that everyone contributes to this fork, because if they managed to split the user base and thereby increasing the amount of work to be done, then they have reached their goal. Don’t let them reach it.
