## Terms of Service  (tl;dr: you from Google? GO AWAY!)

# Alternatives

I personally recommend all users and contributors to switch over to this fork:
### http://iitc.jonatkins.com/ (users)
### https://github.com/jonatkins/ingress-intel-total-conversion (need help, bugs, developers, …)

It’s already been made more resilient to take down notices. I hope that everyone contributes to this fork, because if they managed to split the user base and thereby increasing the amount of work to be done, then they have reached their goal. Don’t let them reach it.

#### what happened?
I asked if IITC was okay and well, the answer is no. It seems Niantic wants to sit this one out, even after *a lot* of people spoke out for IITC. So thank you, dear supporters and shame on you Niantic. They also specifically asked me to refrain from creating Ingress content and while they probably can’t to anything legally, they can still ban my Google account and thus make using my phone *a lot* harder.


##### their forum
Even if you don’t agree with Niantic BE NICE
and don’t spam. Here’s the link to the thread:
